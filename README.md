1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a cross-platform game application based on their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It. They required a software solution that could run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux, while maintaining performance and usability. The application needed to support multiple game sessions, user authentication, and real-time interactions.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

One thing I did particularly well was ensuring the documentation was clear, well-organized, and detailed. I thoroughly outlined the software requirements, architecture, and constraints, which helped in translating the design into code effectively.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was helpful because it provided a clear roadmap for coding. It helped in identifying potential challenges early, ensuring consistency in development, and aligning the software with the client’s requirements. Additionally, it made collaboration easier by serving as a reference for all stakeholders.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, I would improve the scalability section. Initially, the document addressed current needs, but I would enhance it by including more robust strategies for future expansions, such as cloud-based deployment or modular development for easier updates.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed user needs by focusing on ensuring smooth multiplayer functionality and compatibility across platforms. I implemented these needs by choosing a framework that supports cross-platform development and designing an intuitive user interface. Understanding the user’s perspective is crucial because it ensures the final product is functional, efficient, and user-friendly.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached software design using modular development, breaking down the system into manageable components. I also leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to keep the codebase organized and scalable. Moving forward, I would continue using agile development methodologies, iterative prototyping, and user feedback loops to refine the application continuously.
